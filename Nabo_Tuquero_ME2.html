                <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 0;">Alice Guo, a fugitive former mayor in the Philippines accused of having links to Chinese criminal syndicates, has been arrested in Indonesia, according to Manila's justice ministry.</p>

                <p>Guo, the former mayor of Bamban in Tarlac province, was thrust into the spotlight after investigators raided an online casino's sprawling compound in the town in March, finding evidence of financial scams and victims of human trafficking, as well as luxury villas and underground tunnels.
                <br><br>
                Investigators and senators looking into the issue have alleged that Guo was linked to the activities, and that she was not a Philippine national, but in fact Chinese.
                <br><br>
                The investigation into the mayor and questions over her true identity have come at a time of increased tensions between China and the Philippines and gripped the </p>

                country. One senator investigating the issue has asked whether Guo was in fact a Chinese spy.
                <br><br>
                Guo was arrested on Tuesday night at a hotel in the city of Tangerang in Indonesia, and is now in the custody of the Indonesian authorities. It is unclear when she will be extradited to the Philippines. 
                <br><br>
                Guo has denied wrongdoing, saying she is facing “malicious accusations”. She has previously said that she is a Philippine national who was born as the “love child” of a Chinese man and his wife's helper, who was a Filipina, and that she was raised on a pig farm in Bamban.

                The senate issued an arrest warrant for Guo in July, after she failed to appear at a hearing investigating criminal activities in her town.
                <br><br>
                No other arrest warrants have been issued by the courts. However, the Philippines' Anti-Money Laundering Council recently filed several charges of money laundering against Guo and 35 others before the department of justice, accusing them of laundering more than 100m pesos (£1.3m). The Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission has also filed qualified human trafficking charges, now under consideration by the office of the prosecutor.

                Her lawyer has previously said she had been traumatised by the experience of giving evidence before the senate. She was widely mocked online for what many considered her inability to answer basic questions about her childhood.

                <p style="font-size: 90%; text-align: justify;">In a remarkable show of support, tickets for BINI's third concert date at the Araneta Coliseum sold out within just two hours, making the group the first Filipino girl group to achieve this feat at the Smart Araneta Coliseum.
                <br><br>
                “Thank you for your overwhelming support! See you on November 16, 17, and 18!” Star Music PH wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. This news follows the sellouts of the initial two-day “Grand BINIverse” concerts, where tickets were snapped up in under three hours.
                <br><br>
                The rapid sellout of tickets is a testament to BINI's growing popularity and the dedication of their fanbase, known as Blooms. Tickets for both concert dates were initially made available through a pre-sale for exclusive members of the BINI fansite, which quickly sold out.

                Tickets for both concert dates were initially made available through a pre-sale for exclusive members of the BINI fansite, which quickly sold out. The BINI Wand Lucky 88 members had an earlier pre-sale session the day before, during which all tickets were completely sold.

                The general public hoped to secure tickets during the official release, but many were left empty-handed as tickets were swiftly reserved.

                In a situation briefing presided by President Ferdinand R.

                “These are still subject for validation, Mr. President,” the OCD official told the President. Idio also reported that a total of  1,720,568 individuals or 442,804 families were affected by Enteng, with Bicol region the most affected area, followed by Central Luzon, Eastern Visayas, and Metro Manila.

                In an advisory issued at 7 a.m. yesterday, the DPWH warned motorists that the road is no longer passable for all types of vehicle. To get to and from Baguio, motorists can pass thru the Marcos Highway or the Asin-Nangalisan-San Pascual road.
