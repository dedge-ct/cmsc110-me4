        <p class="article-opening">The University of the Philippines (UP) lauded its scientists on Monday after they topped other Philippine higher education institutions in the Alper-Doger (AD) Scientific Index 2025.</p>
        <p class="article-body">
            The AD Scientific Index is a ranking and analysis system of scientific performance that adds value to the scientific output of individual scientists.
            <br><br>
            “UP’s recognition for having the highest concentration of cited scientists underscores the immense value of their work. This recognition not only enhances UP’s reputation but also strengthens our capacity to address complex national challenges,” UP president Angelo Jimenez said in a statement.
            <br><br>
            "On behalf of the University of the Philippines, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to our esteemed UP scientists for leading the nation as the top institution in the AD Scientific Index 2025,” he added.
            <br><br>
            In particular, UP ranked first out of 286 public and private universities in the Philippines; 366th out of the 10,057 universities in Asia; and 1,347th out of 18,584 universities worldwide.
            <br><br>
            Among Philippine institutions, the International Rice Research Institute (Los Baños, Laguna), De La Salle University Manila, UP Diliman, Ateneo de Manila University, University of Santo Tomas, Silliman University (Dumaguete City), UP Los Baños, UP Manila and University of San Agustin (Iloilo) completed the top 10.
            <br><br>
            Jimenez vowed to advance more investments in research and development to help address “complex national challenges.”
            <br><br>
            “UP will continue to invest in essential research resources to empower our scientists in their impactful work. We hope our researchers see UP as fertile ground for making a difference through science,” he said.
            <br><br>
            Former UP president and ex-secretary of the Department of Trade and Industry Alfredo Pascual, meanwhile, urged globalization of scientific research to sustain “high-level innovation” in the country.
            <br><br>
            “These measures will bring quality innovations to the industry. Artificial Intelligence, in particular, is now the lynchpin of these efforts, helping us reach new heights in research and innovation,” he said.
