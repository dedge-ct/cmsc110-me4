        <p class="article-opening">President Ferdinand Marcos Jr on Monday assured that his administration is committed to strengthening its disaster risk reduction and response efforts to prevent the further loss of lives amid the worsening effects of climate change.</p>
        <p class="article-body">
            The Philippine leader made the assurance as he led the distribution of government aid to storm-affected residents during the National Day of Mourning for victims of Severe Tropical Storm Kristine during a program in Talisay, Batangas.
            <br><br>
            "Layunin natin na hindi na maulit ang pagkawala ng buhay dahil sa kalamidad. Totoo na mas matindi ang mga bagyo ngayon – mas malawak, mas malakas, mas mabilis ang pagbabago. Kaya inuulit ko ang mga kautusan sa mga ahensya ng pamahalaan," Marcos Jr said.
            <br><br>
            In his speech, the President directed the Department of Science and Technology to strengthen its warning system and ensure that communities are given timely warnings on approaching storms and typhoons. 
            <br><br>
            "Inatasan ko na rin ang DOST at DILG [Department of Interior and Local Government] na siguruhin ang tama at maayos na komunikasyon sa mga lokal na pamahalaan upang maging handa naman sila ‘pag parating ang kalamidad," the President said. "Patuloy din ang programa ng DILG na Operation Listo na ang layon ay palakasin ang disaster preparedness ng ating mga LGU para sa paghahanda, pagtugon, at pagsubaybay sa mga sakuna."
            <br><br>
            Marcos Jr also ordered the National Irrigation Administration, Department of Energy, Department of Environment and Natural Resources, and the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System to implement the gradual release of water from dams ahead of approaching storms and typhoons to prevent flooding in downstream communities. He directed the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council to review its disaster response strategies and ensure timely distribution of aid to affected communities.
            <br><br>
            The President also directed the Department of Public Works and Highways to ensure that infrastructures are safe and resilient to disasters and other extreme weather events. This includes strengthening the slope protection design of roads and bridges to make these more adapted to climate change.
            <br><br> 
            "Kaugnay nito, ang DTI [Department of Trade and Industry] naman ay kailangan suriin at tiyaking maayos [at] magagandang klase [ang] mga materyales at ibang instrumentong gagamitin para sa mga proyektong ito," he said.
            <br><br>
            The Office of the President meanwhile turned over P10 million of aid to each of the affected Batangas local government units of Talisay, Agoncillo, Cuenca, Lemery, and Balete. The government also distributed P10,000 cash assistance to each of a number of selected farmers and fishermen in Batangas. 
            <br><br>
            The Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development also gave out housing construction materials to 559 families in Batangas whose homes were either damaged or destroyed by Kristine.
            <br><br>
            Prior to this, the President went to Barangay Sampaloc in Talisay Monday morning for the observation of the National Day of Mourning for Victims of Severe Tropical Storm Kristine. A mass was held in the barangay to remember the fatalities of Kristine attended by Marcos and affected residents.
